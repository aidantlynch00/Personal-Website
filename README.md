# Personal-Website
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a single common point for all of my professional accounts, documents, and the projects that I have done. It is a handy resource to share with someone without needing to hand them a resume.
### Languages and Tools
The site is built with HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and PHP. All files were edited in Visual Studio Code and sent to my hosting service via FileZilla, an FTP client. The code in the repository can all be run in a local browser with the exception of 'contact.php' as that runs server-side. As I learn how to debug this file locally I will update this section with the tools required to run the full site locally.
### Known Issues
* The background photo is quite large and can have some issues loading. This was noticed in Safari on both desktop and mobile.
* There is no mobile view for the site.
* If the browser window is small, the project page scroll stops before the end of the content.
* Emails cannot be sent yet. The 'contact.php' file is buggy and I have not yet researched a way to run it locally in order to make debugging easier.
